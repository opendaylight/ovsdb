When we get here we know everything is OK for older schema, which is effectively what you\u0027re representing; I\u0027d recommend simplifying it a little, since there\u0027s no real need for a separate method:\n\n    Assume.assumeFalse(isOldSchema);\n    Assert.assertNotNull(operAa);\n\nand remove the whole (if operAa \u003d\u003d null) block below.",
