      "message": "Queue is a Root table. Hence it can live on its own and hence it should not be added to the ParentColumnToMutate section.\n\nJust as a rule of thumb, this section is populated based on the isRoot schema and this static way to add parent-child relationship should be replaced with a more dynamic isRoot based validation in the library/plugin layer. \n\nBut since it is a non-trivial work, I had kept it simpler for the migration.\nThis work will be done after the collapse.\n\nHence I prefer we not submit this fix.",

      "message": "I see. As this is named ParentColumnToMutate I assumed that this is for all Parent\u003c-\u003eChild refTable type relationships where a mutate is required. I guess the confusion comes in with \"QoS\" which, like \"Queue\", is also a root table.\n\nIf the fix needs to be different, can you please update the bug report and I\u0027ll abandon this change.",
