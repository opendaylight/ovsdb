      "message": "We\u0027re not sure as haven\u0027t been able to figure out how entries in tunnel table get created in first place, the only unknown we have in hwvtp. At very least, creation will always ensure that references to that tunnel/ploc are updated in tables that refer to them. We\u0027ll revisit this logic based on testing. We got some testing on physical devices coming up  and hope to have more concrete answers.\n\nAdd a TODO here.",
