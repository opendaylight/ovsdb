      "message": "Really good point, it does add some value. The purpose of this odlparent-lite is mainly to let jenkins know where to publish the artifacts on a mvn deploy. This was added by Thanh to avoid adding the distributionManagement in every pom that was failing to publish the artifact.",

      "message": "In fact I just understood something, this pom represents the aggregator for all utils bundles, thus shouldn\u0027t be deployed. It is used only to be able to start the build process. It need to use odlparent as parent and need to have this section: https://github.com/opendaylight/armoury/blob/master/pom.xml#l37L55 so it is not deployed",
