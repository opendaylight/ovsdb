      "message": "I would suggest having this method under OvsdbInventoryServiceImpl instead of SouthboundImpl?\n\nIt seems to me that this is not related to southbound at all. That is the main reason I\u0027m saying that.\nAlso, OvsdbInventoryServiceImpl seems to be a good match for this method.\n\nWaiting on your thoughts :)",

It just happens that all the mdsal interactions we do so far use the southbound and this is the first to use something else.\n\nmoving it to OvsdbInvenntoryServiceImpl will work and keeps its invocation in the same path as calling it in the OvsdbDataChangeListener.",
