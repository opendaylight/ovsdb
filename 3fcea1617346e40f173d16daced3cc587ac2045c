      "message": "This could end up negative if the last connection attempt took longer than the next scheduled interval or if clock drift occurred. The possibility is small but there.\n\nYou should use System.nanoTime to avoid the possibility of clock drift. If the delay is negative, cap it at 10000.\n\nOr you could simplify it and just schedule the next try starting at the end of the last try instead of factoring in the elapsed time, i.e. use fixed delay instead of fixed rate. So just return \"connectionAttempt.get() * 10000\" and remove lastRetryTimestamp or isTaskReadyForRetry. Eg if the first connection attempt took 10 sec to fail is there much point in trying again immediately as it will most likely fail again? Maybe if the OS retries under the hood during that time but I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027s the case.",
