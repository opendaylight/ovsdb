      "message": "Though setMutations is a perfectly legitimate way to set the mutations for the operation, it doesn\u0027t fit very well with the existing design of isolating the json serialization/deserialization mechanism from the API. Hence if you look @ Update.java, you will see that we have a method named \"set\" which abstracts the Rows object. It also makes the class API friendly for apps to use intuitively.\n\nWe can take a similar approach instead of a set() we can call it mutate().\n\nI can send a proposal patch which you can make use of if you find it useful.",
