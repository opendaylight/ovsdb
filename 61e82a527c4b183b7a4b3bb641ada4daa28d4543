      "message": "Not entirely. The timeout comment from the other diff is on the availability of schema and doesnt affect the Monitor response.\nThough it is tempting to add something similar to the monitor case, we shouldn\u0027t do that because the monitor Updates() are asynchronous in nature and a real client (not a Test Client) having to wait for it doesnt seem to be appropriate and hence leaving this IT-only code as is is reasonable.",

      "message": "Your point is valid. But not for the IT code. That is because, the 6640 value today is used in the plugin layer. Since the Library work is not fully done, we are not yet handling the Passive connection yet.\nWhen we actually handle the Passive connection code, we have to worry about this and we will introduce it in the appropriate place and lets use that value when it is available. No point adding it somewhere now and then changing it again.",
