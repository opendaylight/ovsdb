      "message": "Vinh, at the time of reconciliation there is no way to figure out whether the termination point present in config data store is actually created at the time of bridge creation of after the bridge creation. I think it does not matter at the time of reconciliation. I think we should trigger the termination point whenever we should see bridge in the operational data store, but we should read all the bridge and termination point configuration whenever switch connects to the controller. Do you see any issue with that approach? I think that approach will be cleaner. Thoughts?",
