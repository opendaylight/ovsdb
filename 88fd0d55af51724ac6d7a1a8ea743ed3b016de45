      "message": "There are autogenerated files when you compile yang that get dumped into the src/main/java/../yang/ dir. They text in there normally blows up on the 120 char line limit.\n\nYes, it would be good to add to odlparent. I thought it was there already but it wasn\u0027t working. It might be that the placement of those java files moved so possibly the exclude doesn\u0027t work anymore.\n\nOr we could just not use the exclude. The java file is autogenerated on the first build and after that not again. So we could build it, then fix it for checkstyle.",
