      "message": "Minor comment.\nAs i understand, the reason we decided to use a name like unique is because the keyword \"new\" is taken by the programming language and it conflicts with OVSDB\u0027s \u0027new\u0027 directive.\n\nSince, this is an internal issue of the wire-protocol, we can call the accessor/setter as getNew and setNew, while the actual private member variable can be \u0027unique\u0027.\n\nThis way, we need not expose the \u0027unique\u0027 limitation (no pun intended :-) ). If you agree can you please change the getUnique and setUnique to getNew \u0026 setNew (here and other classes as well).",
