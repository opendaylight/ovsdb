I\u0027m not quite sure how to rename it.\n\nIts *not* a classic setter, because you don\u0027t tell it what to set.\n\nIts *really* either *getting* the UUID if its set, *or* its *setting* it and returning it to you if its not.\n\nSo perhaps *extractNamedUUID* would be better?  It is extracting it, and if its not set, it sets it for you.\n\nThoughts?",
