      "message": "physical locator is now under physical switch? am i right?\n\nI still think it should be a part of global node, since locator is just a IP and encapsulation type. Its name \"physical locator\" is misleading since it is not \"physical\". It has no connection with physical siwtch just like logcial switch does. I think put locator and logical switch under same position will be better.",
