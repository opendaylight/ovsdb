      "message": "All exceptions store their stacktrace (fillInStackTrace() called by the Throwable constructors); the logger then determines whether or not to output the stacktrace when logging the exception. I use this() here rather than super() because the 3-parameter constructor builds on the 1-parameter constructor in this class, not in the parent class; effectively it\u0027s the same here, but if we ever add code to the 1-parameter constructor it would be nice to have it taken into account by the 3-parameter constructor. The other two constructors are only defined here to expose them to users of this class; they can\u0027t build on each other, they just call their equivalent super-constructor.\n\nActually your comment makes me realise that the other two constructors aren\u0027t used and aren\u0027t needed, so I\u0027ll remove them (which means using super() in this constructor!).",
