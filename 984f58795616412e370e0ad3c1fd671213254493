INFRAUTILS-44, the c/72766 (I4632ae9d27029175ad7935cd6b7567f142e76727) just got merged, so that is a non-issue; and therefore removing my initial self -1.\n\nRe. your point, I\u0027m afraid that you seem to assume that I understand a lot more about OVSDB internals than I actually do... ;-) What I have done in this change is relatively \"mechanical\" - as a first step.  I think this would work?  If you think that it can be improved upon based on what you wrote (which I am unable to translate into code without learning a lot more about OVSDB), perhaps you would like to do that in follow-up change to this?",
