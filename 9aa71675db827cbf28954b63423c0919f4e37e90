If this is correct,  I would say it is better to not set that value value to null so that it shows up in log statements and makes them a little more readable. +1\u0027ing anyway since not really functional.",

      "message": "Hi Joshua,\nThanks for the review.\n\nYes, you are correct, I can take this out.\n\nIn the delete code, there is this check:\n\n   if (neutronFloatingIP.getFixedIPAddress() \u003d\u003d null) {\n            action \u003d Action.DELETE;\n        } else {\n            action \u003d actionIn;\n        }\n\n\nwhich I was attempting to address. But, as you correctly observed, setting floating ip address to null is not needed. I will removed these lines.\n\nThanks",
