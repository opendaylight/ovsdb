DIRECTORY ORGANIZATION
======================

- commons
  +-- parent : Contains Parent pom.xml for all the ovsdb modules.
  +-- integrationtest : Contains the parent pom.xml for all the integrationtest needs.

- distribution : Builds a working controller distribution based on the controller + ovsdb modules and other
                 dependant modules such as openflowplugin
  +-- opendaylight : older, OSGi-based distribution
  +-- opendaylight-karaf : karaf-based distribution

- features : This folder contains all the Karaf related files.

- integrationtest : Contains all the PAX-Exam based integrationTests that covers IT for all the modules.

- library : Contains Schema-independent library that is a reference implementation for RFC 7047.
            This module doesn't depend on any of the Opendaylight components.
            This library module can also be used independently in a non-OSGi environment.

- northbound : Provides AD-SAL style Northbound REST APIs.
               Supports the legacy v2 APIs to provide backward compatibility for Hydrogen Release
               Also supports the newer v3 APIs to provide schema-independent access to the OVSDB protocol.

- openstack
  +-- net-virt : Handles the Openstack Neutron ML2 and Network Service calls and performs all the logic required
                 for Network Virtualization.
  +-- net-virt-providers : Mostly contains data-path programming functionality via OpenFlow or potentially
                           other protocols.

- ovs-sfc : SFC implementation using the OVSDB project. Currently it is just a shell.

- plugin : Contains Opendaylight Southbound Plugin APIs and provides a simpler API interface on top of library layer.
           Ideally, this module should also be schema independent. But due to legacy reasons this layer contains some
           deprecated functionality that assumes openvswitch schema.

- plugin-mdsal-adapter : Adds an MD-SAL Adapter for the OVSDB Plugin. The adapter updates the MD-SAL with nodes
                         as they are added and removed from the inventory. The Yang model provides a reference
                         between OVSDB nodes and the OpenFlow nodes (bridges) that they manage.

- plugin-shell : Contains a Karaf shell framework for OVSDB plugin and printCache command-line.

- resources : Contains some useful resources such as scripts, testing utilities and tools used for deployment
              or testing the binaries generated from the OVSDB project.

- schemas :
  +-- openvswitch : Schema wrapper that represents http://openvswitch.org/ovs-vswitchd.conf.db.5.pdf
  +-- hardwarevtep: Schema wrapper that represents http://openvswitch.org/docs/vtep.5.pdf

- utils : MD-SAL OpenFlow and OVSDB common utilities.

HOW TO BUILD & RUN
==================

Pre-requisites : JDK 1.7+, Maven 3+

1. Building a Karaf Feature and deploying it in an Opendaylight Karaf distribution :
   1. This is a new method for Opendaylight distribution wherein there is no defined editions such
      as Base, Virtualization or SP editions. The end-customer can choose to deploy the required feature
      based on his/her deployment needs.

   2. From the root ovsdb/ directory, execute "mvn clean install"

   3. Next unzip the distribution-karaf-<VERSION_NUMBER>-SNAPSHOT.zip file created from step #2 in
      the directory ovsdb/distribution/opendaylight-karaf/target like so:
      "unzip distribution-karaf-<VERSION_NUMBER>-SNAPSHOT.zip"

   4. Once karaf has started and you see the Opendaylight ascii art in the console, the last step
      is to start the OVSDB plugin framework with the following command in the karaf console:
      "feature:install odl-ovsdb-openstack odl-ovsdb-northbound" (without quotation marks).

   Sample output from Karaf console :

   opendaylight-user@root>feature:list | grep -i ovsdb
   odl-ovsdb-all                    | 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT      |           | ovsdb-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT                  | OpenDaylight :: OVSDB :: all
   odl-ovsdb-library                | 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT      | x         | ovsdb-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT                  | OVSDB :: Library
   odl-ovsdb-schema-openvswitch     | 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT      | x         | ovsdb-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT                  | OVSDB :: Schema :: Open_vSwitch
   odl-ovsdb-schema-hardwarevtep    | 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT      | x         | ovsdb-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT                  | OVSDB :: Schema :: hardware_vtep
   odl-ovsdb-plugin                 | 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT      | x         | ovsdb-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT                  | OpenDaylight :: OVSDB :: Plugin
   odl-ovsdb-northbound             | 0.6.0-SNAPSHOT      |           | ovsdb-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT                  | OpenDaylight :: OVSDB :: Northbound
   odl-ovsdb-openstack              | 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT      | x         | ovsdb-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT                  | OpenDaylight :: OVSDB :: OpenStack Network Virtual
   odl-ovsdb-ovssfc                 | 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT      |           | ovsdb-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT                  | OpenDaylight :: OVSDB :: OVS Service Function Chai


2. Building a bundle and deploying it in an Opendaylight Karaf distribution :
   This method can be used to update and test new code in a bundle. If the bundle of interest is rebuilt as a
   snapshot with the same version as what it already defined in a feature repo then that new bundle will be used
   when the feature is loaded in karaf. If karaf is already running with the feature loaded then follow the steps
   below to load the new bundle:

   1. Find the bundle id of the bundle you are going to rebuild:
      - bundle:list -s | grep <bundlename>, i.e. bundle:list -s | grep odl-ovsdb-plugin

   2. Instruct karaf to watch the new bundle and reload it if it changes:
      - bundle:watch <id>
      - The id is the value returned in 1 above.
      - You can also watch the bundle URL itself:
        - bundle:watch mvn:org.opendaylight.ovsdb/plugin/1.0.2-SNAPSHOT

   3. Rebuild bundle.
      - cd bundle dir, i.e. cd ovsdb/plugin
      - mvn clean install. This will install the new bundle into the local mvn repo.

   4. karaf will see the changed bundle and reload it.


3. Building an OVSDB based Opendaylight Virtualization edition:
   1. This is the legacy way to build and distribute Opendaylight archives. This method was
      followed in Hydrogen. It might still work in Helium but it is best effort for support.
      The preferred method for Helium and later is to use karaf.

   2. From the root folder(that hosts this README), execute "mvn clean install"
      That should build a full distribution archive and distribution directory that will contain
      Opendaylight Controller + OVSDB bundles + Openflow Plugins under
      distribution/opendaylight/target/distribution.ovsdb-X.X.X-osgipackage

   3. Upon successful completion of a build, the Controller with OVSDB can be executed by :
      cd distribution/opendaylight/target/distribution.ovsdb-X.X.X-osgipackage/opendaylight/
      ./run.sh -virt ovsdb

4. Building a Karaf Feature and deploying it in an Opendaylight Karaf distribution :
*** This method is deprecated.
   1. This is a new method for Opendaylight distribution wherein there is no defined editions such
      as Base, Virtualization or SP editions. Rather each of the projects will generate features in
      form of .kar files. The end-customer can choose to deploy the required feature based on his/her
      deployment needs.

   2. From the features/ directory, execute "mvn clean install"
      This will generate a kar file such as "features/target/ovsdb-features-1.2.1-SNAPSHOT.kar"

   3. Download (or build from controller project) the Karaf distribution :
      http://nexus.opendaylight.org/content/repositories/opendaylight.snapshot/org/opendaylight/controller/distribution.opendaylight-karaf/
      Sample zip file :
      http://nexus.opendaylight.org/content/repositories/opendaylight.snapshot/org/opendaylight/controller/distribution.opendaylight-karaf/1.4.2-SNAPSHOT/distribution.opendaylight-karaf-1.4.2-20140718.075612-407.zip

   4. unzip the downloaded (or built) distribution and copy the ovsdb-features-x.x.x.kar file (from step 2) into
      the unzipped distribution.opendaylight-karaf-X.X.X/deploy/ directory.

   5. run Karaf from within the distribution.opendaylight-karaf-X.X.X/ directory using "bin/karaf"

   Sample output from Karaf console :

   opendaylight-user@root>kar:list
   KAR Name
   -----------------------------
   ovsdb-features-1.2.1-SNAPSHOT

   opendaylight-user@root>feature:list | grep ovsdb
   odl-ovsdb-all | 1.2.1-SNAPSHOT | x | ovsdb-1.2.1-SNAPSHOT | OpenDaylight :: OVSDB :: all
   odl-ovsdb-library | 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT | x | ovsdb-1.2.1-SNAPSHOT | OVSDB :: Library

   200 | Active | 80 | 1.0.0.SNAPSHOT | OVSDB hardware_vtep Schema
   201 | Active | 80 | 1.0.0.SNAPSHOT | OpenDaylight OVSDB Plugin

Running The Integration Tests
=============================

To run the integration tests locally the following components are required:

 - Docker
 - Fig or Docker Compose

To install docker, follow the installation guide for your platform:
   http://docs.docker.com/installation/

To install fig:
   http://www.fig.sh/install.html

To install Docker Compose:
   http://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

To run the integration tests:

    mvn clean install
    # The first time you need to set everything up
    fig up -d
    # Later runs only need the containers to be started
    fig start
    # OSX
    mvn verify -Pintegrationtest -Dovsdbserver.ipaddress=$(boot2docker ip 2>/dev/null) -Dovsdbserver.port=6640
    # Linux
    mvn verify -Pintegrationtest -Dovsdbserver.ipaddress=127.0.0.1 -Dovsdbserver.port=6640
    fig stop

On Linux you'll generally need to run fig as root (sudo fig ...).

If you're using Docker Compose, replace "fig" above with "docker-compose" and ignore the warnings.

Skipping unit tests and karaf tests
====================

mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Dskip.karaf=true
