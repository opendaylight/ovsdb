DIRECTORY ORGANIZATION
======================

- commons
  +-- parent : Contains Parent pom.xml for all the ovsdb modules.
  +-- integrationtest : Contains the parent pom.xml for all the integrationtest needs.

- distribution : Builds a working controller distribution based on the controller + ovsdb modules and other
                 dependant modules such as openflowplugin

- features : This folder contains all the Karaf related files.

- integrationtest : Contains all the PAX-Exam based integrationTests that covers IT for all of the above modules.

- library : Contains Schema-independent library that is a reference implementation for RFC 7047.
            This module doesn't depend on any of the Opendaylight components.
            This library module can also be used independently in a non-OSGi environment.

- northbound : Provides AD-SAL style Northbound REST APIs.
               Supports the legacy v2 APIs to provide backward compatibility for Hydrogen Release
               Also supports the newer v3 APIs to provide schema-independent access to the OVSDB protocol.

- of-extension : Adds OpenFlow Nicera extensions.

- openstack
  +-- net-virt : Handles the Openstack Neutron ML2 and Network Service calls and performs all the logic required
                 for Network Virtualization.
  +-- net-virt-providers : Mostly contains data-path programming functionalities via OpenFlow or potentially
                           other protocols.

- ovs-sfc : SFC implementation using the OVSDB project. Currently it is just a shell.

- plugin : Contains Opendaylight Southbound Plugin APIs and provides an simpler API interface on top of library layer.
           Ideally, this module should also be schema independent. But due to legacy reasons this layer contains some
           deprecated functionalities that assume openvswitch schema.

- plugin-mdsal-adapter : Adds an MD-SAL Adapter for the OVSDB Plugin. The adapter updates the MD-SAL with nodes
                         as they are added and removed from the inventory. The Yang model provides a reference
                         between OVSDB nodes and the OpenFlow nodes (bridges) that they manage.

- plugin-shell : Contains a Karaf shell framework for OVSDB plugin and printCache command-line.

- resources : Contains some useful resources such as scripts, testing utilities and tools used for deployment
              or testing the binaries generated from the OVSDB project.

- schemas :
  +-- openvswitch : Schema wrapper that represents http://openvswitch.org/ovs-vswitchd.conf.db.5.pdf
  +-- hardwarevtep: Schema wrapper that represents http://openvswitch.org/docs/vtep.5.pdf

- utils : MD-SAL OpenFlow utilities.

HOW TO BUILD & RUN
==================

Pre-requisites : JDK 1.7+, Maven 3+

1. Building an OVSDB based Opendaylight Virtualization edition :
   1. This is the legacy way to build and distribute Opendaylight archives. And this method was
      followed in Hydrogen and possibly in Helium release as well.

   2. From the root folder(that hosts this README), execute "mvn clean install"
      That should build a full distribution archive and distribution directory that will contain
      Opendaylight Controller + OVSDB bundles + Openflow Plugins under
      distribution/opendaylight/target/distribution.ovsdb-X.X.X-osgipackage

   3. Upon successful completion of a build, the Controller with OVSDB can be executed by :
      cd distribution/opendaylight/target/distribution.ovsdb-X.X.X-osgipackage/opendaylight/
      ./run.sh -virt ovsdb


2. Building a Karaf Feature and deploying it in an Opendaylight Karaf distribution :
   1. This is a new method for Opendaylight distribution wherein there is no defined editions such
      as Base, Virtualization or SP editions. Rather each of the projects will generate features in
      form of .kar files. The end-customer can choose to deploy the required feature based on his/her
      deployment needs.

   2. From the features/ directory, execute "mvn clean install"
      This will generate a kar file such as "features/target/ovsdb-features-1.2.0-SNAPSHOT.kar"

   3. Download (or build from controller project) the Karaf distribution :
      http://nexus.opendaylight.org/content/repositories/opendaylight.snapshot/org/opendaylight/controller/distribution.opendaylight-karaf/
      Sample zip file :
      http://nexus.opendaylight.org/content/repositories/opendaylight.snapshot/org/opendaylight/controller/distribution.opendaylight-karaf/1.4.2-SNAPSHOT/distribution.opendaylight-karaf-1.4.2-20140718.075612-407.zip

   4. unzip the downloaded (or built) distribution and copy the ovsdb-features-x.x.x.kar file (from step 2) into
      the unzipped distribution.opendaylight-karaf-X.X.X/deploy/ directory.

   5. run Karaf from within the distribution.opendaylight-karaf-X.X.X/ directory using "bin/karaf"

   Sample output from Karaf console :

   opendaylight-user@root>kar:list
   KAR Name

Running The Integration Tests
=============================

To run the integration tests locally the following components are required:

 - Docker
 - Fig

To install docker, follow the installation guide for your platform:
   http://docs.docker.com/installation/

To install fig:
   http://www.fig.sh/install.html

To run the integration tests:

    mvn clean install
    fig start
    # OSX
    mvn verify -Pintegrationtest -Dovsdbserver.ipaddress=$(boot2docker ip 2>/dev/null) -Dovsdbserver.port=6640
    # Linux
    mvn verify -Pintegrationtest -Dovsdbserver.ipaddress=127.0.0.1 -Dovsdbserver.port=6640
    fig stop

Skipping unit tests and karaf tests
====================

mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Dskip.karaf=true
