      "message": "That would be a property of ACL Entry as per hwvtep schema. Is direction part of ietf-acl or is that an augmentation you added? If it is latter then we will end up needing similar aug for hwvtep, or need to add that augmentation to a more generic place as security groups/acl-service and hwvtep ACLs can be used independent of each other.",

      "message": "Direction is currently part of acl-service augmentation. There each acl rule can have it own direction. So an access list which contain muliple rules, can have  rules in both ingress and egress direction. I am not sure the case is same here . Is here it is like applying the ACL a whole in ingress or egress not at the rules level.",

      "message": "yes, this will point directly to relevant entry in the ietf-acl model. ACL and ACL Entries in hwvtep schema are very similar to the ietf-acl model, for most part. So the fields that are common we get off there, rest are local to hwvtep schema. ACL service code will populate ietf-acl, then add reference to it in hwvtep to apply it on TOR device. HWVTEP Plugin code will pull in attributes from ietf model and push to the switch.",
