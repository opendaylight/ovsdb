      "message": "When reviewing this code, i just realized that it is better to leave the HTTP_CREATED as the return type.\n\nThough we dont handle subnet creation, it is okay to return success. This is because returning a failure will result in a failure to the user on the OpenStack side. Actually, even though we dont handle the Subnet creation, we can still handle traffic bridging within this subnet.\n\nYes, We dont support Routing and we dont even handle that, so it will certainly result in a failure which is correct.\nBut I think leaving Subnet returning a success is correct at this point even though we dont do anything specific.\n\nWhen we support Routing functionalities, I think we can beef up the functionality here.",
