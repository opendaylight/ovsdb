      "message": "So there are characters one puts in a name that are banned in the nameduuid... specifically \u0027-\u0027.  So if you use the name, you risk failure simply because your name contains a perfectly valid \u0027-\u0027 character.  But using a randomuuid, you insure uniqueness here *and* don\u0027t artificially restrict the name.  This is why the fix was done for BridgeCreateCommand, just propagating it here :)",
