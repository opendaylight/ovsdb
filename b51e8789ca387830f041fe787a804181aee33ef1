      "message": "Does it make sense to update termination point without an existing bridge?\n\nThe bug is reproduced by adding bridge + termination point configuration to the config DS. In this case, the termination point is created along with the bridge configuration. Therefore, I would think the TerminationPointCreateCommand is used instead of TerminationPointUpdateCommand",

      "message": "Hi.  So, the bug report is about an error that occurs when a POST creates a bridge and termination points at the same time.\n\nThis patch is reported to fix the bug, so the question here appears to be: why does changing TerminationPointUpdateCommand fix the problem instead of changing TerminationPointCreateCommand?\n\nI don\u0027t know the answer to that (and if this behavior implies a different issue or not).\n\nThat said, the patch itself looks ok to me.",
