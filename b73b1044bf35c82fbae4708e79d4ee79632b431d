      "message": "You can extend AbstractDataBrokerTest here, to use a \"real\" MD-SAL data broker. That way, tests can perform real operations (read, put, merge, delete) on an MD-SAL that can be checked afterwards. E.g. do a bare-bones put on the MD-SAL, then use MdsalUtilsAsync.read() to check that the read() implementation works; and again without the put to check that it handles missing data. You can probably also provoke failures in this way to test the onFailure paths, e.g. with a put on an instance identifier with missing parents.",
