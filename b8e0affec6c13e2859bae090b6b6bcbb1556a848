      "message": "The changes look good. But the RFC 7047 is not definite on this format. This text is from Section 3.2 of RFC 7047 : \n\n\" The \"version\" reports the version of the database schema.  It is REQUIRED to be present.  Open vSwitch semantics for \"version\" are described in [DB-SCHEMA].  Other schemas may use it differently.\".\n\nDoes that mean, this format of major.minor.patch with decimals is specific to ovs-vswitchd schemas and can be different for other schemas ? In that case, should we be including this in the schema-independent library ?",
