      "message": "I am wondering whether this cleanup() method should be called by the *Handler code e.g LBaasHandler. All these handler should listen to node add/remove event and then ask the cleanup from NeutronL3Adapter or anyone who is implementing the service, rather then service implementer do the cleanup internally without letting them know. Also *Handler call can probably have better context on what needs to cleaned up.  Although with the existing implementation, it would be mere refactoring, but i feel architecturally that would be better options. Flavio/Sam, what\u0027s your thoughts?",
