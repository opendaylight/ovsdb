      "message": "This was added as a hack in Hydrogen timeframe to take care of a race-condition. It is not appropriate to issue a call to rowRemoved from a Neutron bundle because this is a call that is owned by the Plugin\u0027s inventory Service.\n\nSince we dont have a better alternative, I will leave this change here as you have done for now. We can revisit this at a later point.\n\nThis is just a comment to give a history to developers and reviewers.\nNo action needed for now.",
