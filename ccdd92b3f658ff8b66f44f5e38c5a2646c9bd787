What I thought is maybe this one here had already been implemented in some helper or utils method somewhere in the southbound. This code here is pretty basic so I thought we might already have a method for it.\n\nAnother thing to look at is the following code. it relies on the bridgeOperationState to be set for every AbstractTransactCommand() so I think there should always be a bridge but can\u0027t recall. Idea is only to avoid having to read form mdsal if we already have the bridge.\n\nInstanceIdentifier\u003cOvsdbBridgeAugmentation\u003e bridgeIid \u003d\n                        entry.getKey().firstIdentifierOf(OvsdbBridgeAugmentation.class);\n                Optional\u003cOvsdbBridgeAugmentation\u003e bridgeOptional \u003d\n                        getOperationalState().getOvsdbBridgeAugmentation(bridgeIid);",
