      "message": "Look at Andre\u0027s comment for patchset2. There is already a netvirt-impl with same artifact-id and name space in OVSDB project. When trying to bring up features that use both Andre was running into exception. You were on vacation and this was the best Andre and I could come up with. Can you take a look at that and suggest a better solution?",

      "message": "As I understand it the conflict is between the openstack/net-virt and netvirt-impl YANG modules, is that correct? I\u0027d rather keep the Maven artifact and YANG modules consistent, so netvirt-new-impl seems better in the short term. (If openstack/net-virt is removed later we can always rename this one...)",
