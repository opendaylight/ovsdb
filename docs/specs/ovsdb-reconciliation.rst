OVSDB Reconciliation
=====================

https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/q/topic:ovsdb-reconciliation

Add support for reconciliation in ovsdb for tunnel interfaces and bridges.


Problem description
===================

We don't want anybody to tinker with switch configuration for entities
owned by the controller, switch configuration should be identical
to what is there in the controller config.

Use Cases
---------
The following usecases are supported

* Use case 1: Reconciliation after controller reboot
* Use case 2: Reconciliation after switch re-connection
* Use case 3: Reconciliation after controller upgrade
* Use case 4: Reconciliation after switch connects back to
  different controller in a cluster of controllers
* Use case 5: Reconciliation should happen in both controller
  initiated and switch initiated connections


Proposed change
===============

Controller should do reconciliation only on entities owned by the controller.
For this we need to identify entities created by controller. Currently we use
the key-value pair "opendaylight-iid:"operational datastore node Id" to stamp
the entities created by the controller, but for a future proof solution this
feature will add another key-value pair "created_by:odl" to stamp the entities
created by the controller. This key-value pair will go in the external_ids
column of ovsdb tables in switch.

This feature will support only create and delete reconciliation, create
reconciliation is already implemented, see references 3 & 4. Update reconciliation
is not supported in this feature. Bridge and tunnel interface delete reconciliations
are handled in this feature. This feature should handle both switch initiated and
controller initiated connections.

In order to handle reconciliation in a generic way, we will follow below steps

#. Switch connects
#. Check whether upgrade is going on
#. if upgrade flag is not set, reconcile and publish the switch
#. if flag is set, publish switch and reconcile when upgrade flag is down

In current implementation both reconciliation and publishing to Oper DS are
two parallel tasks. Reconciliation will be done in datastore transact commands
where we compare, switch configuration got from OVSDB monitor callback and what 
is there in config datastore.

The Scope of the reconciliation will be kept only to br-int bridge. Support for
delete reconciliation for Qos Service is not in this scope of this spec.

**Handling various scenarios**

* Non upgrade scenario(upgrade flag is down)
   - New switch connects: There is no configuration in the controller and switch,
     first reconciliation kicks in, nothing to reconcile, then publishes switch
     to oper DS.

   - Existing switch flaps: There is same configuration in both controller and switch,
     reconciliation code retains the same in switch, then switch gets published to OperDS
     Switch connect is not the trigger for every config reconciliation. Currently
     Bridge configuration reconciliation is getting triggered upon gaining eos ownership and
     TerminationPoint reconciliation is getting triggered after the bridge appears
     in oper datastore.

   - Existing switch flaps with some change in configuration: Here create reconciliation
     should push the new configuration to switch, and delete reconciliation should delete
     the old ones, and push the switch to Oper DS.

* Auto-Tunnel scenario (non upgrade, upgrade flag is down)
   - New switch connects: same as above

   - Existing switch flaps: same as above

   - Existing switch flaps with change in tep/tz configuration: delete reconciliation should
     delete the old tunnels and publish to Oper DS, now auto-tunnel module should take care
     of creating new teps.

* Upgrade scenario (replay based upgrade, upgrade flag will be set for sometime)
   - New switch connects: if upgrade flag is set don't reconcile, publish the switch to Oper
     DS, when upgrade flag is down, reconcile

   - existing switch connects back: same as above

   - existing switch connects back(auto-tunnel): when switch connects back, check upgrade flag.
     If flag is set, dont reconcile, publish switch to Oper DS. When upgrade flag becomes down,
     reconcile.

In certain scenarios there will be traffic hit, like when we do reconciliation while system is
updrading

#. If Itm auto-tunnel module didn't get a chance to run before upgrade flag goes down, and if ovsdb
   plugin runs first, then it will delete all the teps first, which will result in a traffic hit.
#. If switch connects after the upgrade flag is down, then reconciliation will delete all the teps,
   this also will result in a traffic hit
