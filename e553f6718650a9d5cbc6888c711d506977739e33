      "message": "Yes, it is a lot faster now. Vagrant can create 2 VMs in about 3mins. Actually, I couldn\u0027t find the rpm online. So I ran the ovs build, then pulled the rpm after it was done and pushed it to dropbox. I then changed the script to simply download this build from dropbox. If we need to rebuild or use a different ovs version, we only need to point the Vagrant file to ovsnode_build.pp to create the new rpm.",
