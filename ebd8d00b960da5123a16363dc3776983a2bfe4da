      "message": "Its awesome that the mockito helps in stubbing in the 1 level deeper method and effectively narrowing down the UT to a particular method as it is supposed to.\nBut, I see the UT/IT also as a place to express the use-case of inputting a certain kind of data and expected output. Developers and other technical folks can use it a mechanism to better understand the code.\nIn that line of thinking, I think it would be awesome if we can return a more realistic output for OperationResult (rather than an empty result as it is done now).\n\nFor example, since you are performing an op.insert(), it would be awesome if the operationResult is mocked with a more realistic output or an Insert Result containing UUID as expressed in RFC 7047.\n\nAlso the assert mechanism can make sure it validates the result more appropriately.  In addition, I would be great to add a use-case where the transaction fails.\n\nThis comment is applicable for most of the methods defined here.",
