      "message": "I guess you are assuming here that if the jsonNode contains \"rows\" as a key, it has to be a response for Select operation  and hence the following code will work naturally.\n\nBut, I think such assumptions might cause trouble in the long run and is also not readable. What is your opinion on using the Operation Type (such as Select) as the validation check ?\n\non the other hand, it is good to have this check to be based on \"rows\", because it will automatically handle the error conditions. \n\nSo, do you think it will be a good idea to have a convenience method like isSelectOperationResponse(jsonNode). Which will internally check for jsonNode.get(\"rows\") ?\n\nThis will make the code more readable and also handles the error case automatically as well.\n\nWhat do you think ?",
