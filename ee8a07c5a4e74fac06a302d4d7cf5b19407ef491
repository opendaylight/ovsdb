      "message": "I guess you are assuming here that if the jsonNode contains \"rows\" as a key, it has to be a response for Select operation  and hence the following code will work naturally.\n\nBut, I think such assumptions might cause trouble in the long run and is also not readable. What is your opinion on using the Operation Type (such as Select) as the validation check ?\n\non the other hand, it is good to have this check to be based on \"rows\", because it will automatically handle the error conditions. \n\nSo, do you think it will be a good idea to have a convenience method like isSelectOperationResponse(jsonNode). Which will internally check for jsonNode.get(\"rows\") ?\n\nThis will make the code more readable and also handles the error case automatically as well.\n\nWhat do you think ?",

      "message": "The thing that worries me most here is that we have an undocumented assumption that Select will be the only thing returning with \"rows\" which while true today may not hold true tomorrow...\n\nFurthermore it would be cool to lay the foundation for extensibility here if we need to perform other transformations for other types of operation in future...\n\nMy suggestion would be to modify the logic as follows:\nhttps://gist.github.com/anonymous/cb3f81d2606d2035bcea\n\nThis assumes a 1:1 correlation between position in the operations list and postion in the JsonNodes list...\n\nThe idea would be to add a util function \"transformSelectResult\" to do the transformation in this instance, and the case statement could be expanded using this same pattern in future.\n\nMy $0.02 ;)",
