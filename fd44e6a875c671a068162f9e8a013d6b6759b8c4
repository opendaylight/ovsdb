      "message": "For controller initiated connection we should overwrite the value every time we connect, because we write the node-id that user used to dump the data in the data store, if we reuse the old data from data store, there is a possibility that you end up with two different node-id in config and operational data store and it will break the functionality. This is the same code i am re-using that is used to update the node.",
