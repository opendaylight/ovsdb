/**
 * Copied from org.opendaylight.ovsdb.southbound.reconciliation.ReconciliationManager
 *
 * This class provides the implementation of ovsdb southbound plugins
 * configuration reconciliation engine. This engine provide interfaces
 * to enqueue (one time retry)/ enqueueForRetry(periodic retry)/ dequeue
 * (remove from retry queue) reconciliation task. Reconciliation task can
 * be a connection reconciliation or configuration reconciliation of any
 * ovsdb managed resource like bridge, termination point etc. This engine
 * execute all the reconciliation task through a fixed size thread pool.
 * If submitted task need to be retry after a periodic interval they are
 * submitted to a single thread executor to periodically wake up and check
 * if task is ready for execution.
 * Ideally, addition of any type of reconciliation task should not require
 * any change in this reconciliation manager execution engine.
 *
 * 3-Node Cluster:
 * Reconciliation manager is agnostic of whether it's running in single
 * node cluster or 3-node cluster. It's a responsibility of the task
 * submitter to make sure that it submit the task for reconciliation only
 * if it's an owner of that device EXCEPT controller initiated Connection.
 * Reconciliation of controller initiated connection should be done by all
 * the 3-nodes in the cluster, because connection to individual controller
 * can be interrupted for various reason.
