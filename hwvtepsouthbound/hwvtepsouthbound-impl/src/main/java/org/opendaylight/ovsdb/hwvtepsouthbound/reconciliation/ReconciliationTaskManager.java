/**
 * Copied from org.opendaylight.ovsdb.southbound.reconciliation.ReconciliationTaskManager
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is a task cache manager that provides a cache to store
 * the task that is queued for the reconciliation. Whenever new task
 * is submitted to the reconciliation manager, it will be cached in
 * the cache. If the reconciliation is successful or it's done with
 * all the attempt of reconciliation,
 *
 * <p>
 * Caching of the task is required, because reconciliation task might
 * require longer duration to reconcile and there is a possibility that
 * meanwhile user can change the configuration in config data store while
 * task is queued for the reconciliation. In that scenario, reconciliation
 * manager should not attempt any further reconciliation attempt for that
 * task. ReconciliationManager will call cancelTask() to cancel the task.
