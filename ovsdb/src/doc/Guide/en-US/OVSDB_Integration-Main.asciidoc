=== Introduction

OVSDB Integration is a bundle for OpenDaylight that will implement the
Open vSwitch Database management protocol, allowing southbound
configuration of vSwitches. Please join us and clone our repository:

=== Example Usage

OVSDB is a critical protocol for Network Virtualization with Open
vSwitch forwarding elements.

=== Issues

* jsonrpc4j does not provide the bidirectional capabilities that we need
to create calls, and respond to echo as well. There are several options
being investigated:

* integration of http://deavid.github.io/bjsonrpc/[bjsonrpc] via Jython

* Create our own json-rpc implementation.

* Add the functionality needed to jsonrpc4j

* Continue working on fully integrating the full functionality of the
protocol OVSDB.

== Technical Overview


=== JSON-RPC Overview

JSON-RPC is a remote procedure protocol which allows our ovsdb client to
call methods that exist on the ovsdb server, allowing us to provision
bridges, ports, interfaces, tunnels, and more in the database. Any rpc
request is formatted as follows:

----
{
    "method":<string>,
    "params":[<object>],
    "id":<string> or <integer>
}
----

This will invoke the value given in "method" on the server, passing in
the parameters specified in order. Parameters can be simple strings, or
complicated json objects. RPC response messages also have a standard
formatting:

----
{
    "result":[<object>],
    "error":<error>,
    "id":<string> or <integer>
}
----

The library https://code.google.com/p/jsonrpc4j/[jsonrpc4j] will take
care of serializing and deserializing these standard messages for us,
but for most situations we will need to deserialize the "result" value
ourselves as it is most likely a complicated json object. Also, for many
methods the "params" array will contain json objects, we define these as
actual java objects which then get deserialized into json strings on the
server side. Using the jackson streaming API it is possible to call
methods and process responses using only string manipulation, but it is
less convenient and as of now we are not using this method. The
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pfaff-ovsdb-proto-02#section-4.1[ovsdb
protocol draft] describes the methods and their responses in detail.

=== Example: add bridge and associated port and interface

                    "named-uuid",
                    "new_bridge"
                ]
            },
            "table": "Open_vSwitch",
            "uuid-name": "new_switch",
            "op": "insert"
        },
